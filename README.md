# My GAN Learning Journey
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my journey in learning and experimenting with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This repository is not just a collection of code but a reflection of my progress and understanding of this fascinating area of deep learning.

## Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks have revolutionized the way we think about generative models. In this repository, I explore various GAN architectures, experiment with different datasets, and share my findings and insights.

## Repository Structure
- my-gan-zoo/: List of gan from my journey
- datasets/: List of datasets that i used.
- readme.md: the opening documentation

*This repository is a personal project driven by passion for AI and deep learning.*
